Assalamualaikum and hi! 👋
# It's me, NuruTheDoomer! (it's he/him)
I'm simply just a Malaysian Doom speedrunner (for the No Monsters and No Monsters 100% Secrets category in particular), Doom soundtrack uploader, and also a (newbie) mapper</p>
Don't expect much stuff here for now ;)</p></p>

I have a YouTube channel where I uploaded Doom speedruns and soundtracks, as well as showcases of my own map, my Ironman runs, and all sorts of Doom-related stuff from time to time. Click the badge above to check it out!</p>
Here's [my redirects page](https://sites.google.com/view/np-redirect-site/nuruthedoomer) to help bring you to other places I'm just so happen to be in. Also, I got a [DoomWiki article](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/NuruTheDoomer), somehow... Check it out! And while you're there check out [my user page](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/User:NuruTheDoomer) for stuff like the list of all the maps that I have made ;)

> I'm also currently working on the "Malindo Doom" project, which plans to add Malay and Indonesian translation for various Classic Doom source ports (currently on hold for the time being)

And here's my speedrunning pages:
- [Doom Speed Demos Archive](https://dsdarchive.com/players/nuruthedoomer) (for non-Unity/non-KEX port runs)
- [Speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/users/NuruTheDoomer) (for Unity/KEX port runs, which is pretty rare, but it's there)

For more fancy stats of my DSDArchive runs, checkout [this website](https://beta.doomspeedruns.com/players/nuruthedoomer/stats)!
